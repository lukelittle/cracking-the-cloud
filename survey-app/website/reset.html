<!--
reset.html - Admin Page for Resetting Survey Data

WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
Provides an admin interface to delete all survey votes from the database.
This is a destructive operation that cannot be undone.

KEY CONCEPTS FOR STUDENTS:
1. Destructive Operations: How to implement "dangerous" actions safely
2. User Confirmation: JavaScript confirm() dialog for user verification
3. Feedback Messages: Displaying success/error messages to users
4. Administrative Functions: Separating admin tools from user interfaces

SECURITY NOTE:
In a production app, this page would require authentication/authorization.
Anyone with the URL can currently reset the survey!

WORKFLOW:
Admin visits page → Clicks reset button → JavaScript shows confirmation dialog →
If confirmed, calls resetSurvey() in main.js → API deletes all data → Shows result
